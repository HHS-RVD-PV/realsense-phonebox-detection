# realsense-phonebox-detection
This repository contains the code that was used to detect a phone box from 10 to 100 cm height.
This test was conducted to test the accuracy of a intel realsense d435 and choising an optimal distance from the camera to the package.
In this code libraries and examples of the realsense sdk are used.
There is also an excel sheet with results from the readings in this repository.
